# MQTT client library

This repo contains the MQTT client library that can work with the family of Infineon connectivity devices. This library uses the AWS IoT device SDK MQTT client library and implements the glue layer that is required for the library to work with Infineon&trade; connectivity platforms.

The ModusToolbox&trade; MQTT client code examples download this library automatically, so you don't need to.



## Features

All features supported by the [AWS IoT device SDK MQTT library](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/202103.00) are supported by this library.

Some of the key features include:

- MQTT 3.1.1 client

- Synchronous API for MQTT operations

- Multi-threaded API by default

- Complete separation of MQTT and network stack, allowing MQTT to run on top of any network stack

- Supports MQTT persistent sessions

- Supports Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels 0, 1, and 2

- Supports MQTT connections over both secured and non-secured TCP connections

- Supports authentication based on both X509 certificate and SAS tokens for MQTT connection with Azure broker

- Glue layer implementation for MQTT library to work on Infineon&trade; connectivity platforms

**Note:** Using this library in a project will cause the AWS IoT device SDK to be downloaded on your computer. It is your responsibility to understand and accept the AWS IoT Device SDK license.

## Dependent libraries

This MQTT client library depends on the following libraries. These libraries are included by default.

- [AWS IoT device SDK port](https://github.com/Infineon/aws-iot-device-sdk-port)

- [AWS IoT device SDK MQTT library](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/202103.00)

## Quick start

1. Ensure that the application includes *./include/cy_mqtt_api.h* to use the library APIs and structure.

2. The referenced file *./include/core_mqtt_config.h* that is bundled with this library provides the default configurations required for the [AWS IoT device SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/202103.00) library.

3. By default [AWS IoT device SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/tree/202103.00) library logging is turned off. To enable log messages, logging related macro's `LogError`, `LogWarn`, `LogInfo`, and `LogDebug` in *./include/core_mqtt_config.h* should be mapped to the application-specific logging implementation.

4. Define the following macros in the application Makefile with values to suit the use case and network conditions:

   Macro | Description | Example
   ------|-------------|-------
   `CY_MQTT_ACK_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | A "reasonable amount of time" (timeout value) to wait for receiving the acknowledgment packet from the MQTT broker for MQTT publish/subscribe messages with QoS1/QoS2 | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_ACK_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS=3000`
   `CY_MQTT_MESSAGE_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS` | MQTT message send timeout | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_MESSAGE_SEND_TIMEOUT_MS=3000`
   `CY_MQTT_MESSAGE_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | MQTT message receive timeout | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_MESSAGE_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS=500`
   `CY_MQTT_MAX_RETRY_VALUE` | MQTT library retry mechanism for MQTT publish/subscribe/unsubscribe messages if the acknowledgement is not received from the broker on time. You can configure the maximum number of retries. | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_MAX_RETRY_VALUE=3`
   `CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_PUBLISHES` | If user need to perform multiple publish operations simultaneously on a single MQTT instance, then `CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_PUBLISHES` macro needs be configured with the number of simultaneous publish operation that user wants to perform. For the default value of this macro, refer to MQTT library API header file. This macro can be configured by adding a define in the application Makefile. | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_PUBLISHES=2`
   `CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_SUBSCRIBES` | If user need to perform multiple subscribe operations simultaneously on a single MQTT instance, then `CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_SUBSCRIBES` macro needs be configured with the number of simultaneous subscribe operation that user wants to perform. For the default value of this macro, refer to MQTT library API header file. This macro can be configured by adding a define in the application Makefile. | `DEFINES += CY_MQTT_MAX_OUTGOING_SUBSCRIBES=2`
   `MQTT_PINGRESP_TIMEOUT_MS` | A "reasonable amount of time" (timeout value) to wait for keepalive response from the MQTT broker | `DEFINES += MQTT_PINGRESP_TIMEOUT_MS=5000`
   `MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS` | A "maximum polling duration" that is allowed without any data reception from the network for the incoming packet | `DEFINES += MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS=1000`
   `MQTT_SEND_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS` | A "maximum duration" that is allowed for no data transmission over the network through the transport send function | `DEFINES += MQTT_SEND_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS=500`
<br>

**Note:** It is important to note that having `MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS` timeout too short will result in MQTT being disconnected due to the possibility of partial data being received. If you have small TCP buffers and a high latency network, the optimum value for the timeout can be surprisingly long. In such cases, optimum value for the timeout can be better determined based on experimenting the MQTT applications with payloads bigger than the TCP buffer. See [AWS coreMQTT documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/embedded-csdk/202103.00/lib-ref/libraries/standard/coreMQTT/docs/doxygen/output/html/mqtt_timeouts.html#mqtt_timeouts_receive_polling) for more details.<br>

5.  5. Review and make the required changes to the pre-defined configuration files.
 - The configuration files are bundled with the wifi-mw-core library for FreeRTOS, lwIP, and Mbed TLS. See [README.md](https://github.com/Infineon/wifi-mw-core/blob/master/README.md) for details.
 - If the application is using bundle library then the configuration files are in the bundle library. For example if the application is using **Wi-Fi core freertos lwip mbedtls bundle library**, the configuration files are in `wifi-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls/configs` folder. Similarly if the application is using **Ethernet Core FreeRTOS lwIP mbedtls library**, the configuration files are in `ethernet-core-freertos-lwip-mbedtls/configs` folder.

6. Define the following COMPONENTS in the application's Makefile for the Azure port library.
    ```
    COMPONENTS=FREERTOS MBEDTLS LWIP SECURE_SOCKETS
    ```

7. The 'aws-iot-device-sdk-port' layer includes the 'coreHTTP' and 'coreMQTT' modules of the 'aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C' library by default. If the user application does not use HTTP client features, update the application Makefile to exclude the coreHTTP source files from the build. The Makefile entry should look like as follows:
    ```
    CY_IGNORE+= $(SEARCH_aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C)/libraries/standard/coreHTTP
    CY_IGNORE+= libs/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/libraries/standard/coreHTTP
    ```

8. For a secured platform like CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W, define the following macros in the application Makefile:

   Macro | Description | Example
   ------|-------------|-------
   `CY_TFM_PSA_SUPPORTED` <br> <br>`TFM_MULTI_CORE_NS_OS` | When the MQTT library used on secured platform such as CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W | `DEFINES+=CY_TFM_PSA_SUPPORTED TFM_MULTI_CORE_NS_OS`
   `CY_SECURE_SOCKETS_PKCS_SUPPORT` | Enables PKCS-PSA support on secured platforms such as CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W | `DEFINES+=CY_SECURE_SOCKETS_PKCS_SUPPORT`
<br>

**Note:** Secured platform like CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W use trusted-firmware-m library for crypto operations. Due to security vulnerability in HW acceleration, trusted-firmware-m version v1.3.3 uses software implementation for ECC crypto algorithm. Since the software implementation is slower, it is recommended to set configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP to atleast 100.
    
    - configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP value can be changed in the application's FreeRTOSConfig.h

9. Add the trusted firmware library include path before the MBEDTLS library include path in the application Makefile. This is required to compile the MQTT library for secured platforms such as CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W. The Makefile entry should look like as follows:
    ```
    INCLUDES=$(SEARCH_trusted-firmware-m)/COMPONENT_TFM_NS_INTERFACE/include
    INCLUDES+=libs/trusted-firmware-m/COMPONENT_TFM_NS_INTERFACE/include
    ```

**Note:** This MQTT client library does not support secured connections to the public `test.mosquitto.org` broker by default because the server uses the SHA1 hashing algorithm. As cautioned by Mbed TLS, SHA-1 is considered a weak message digest and is therefore not enabled in Mbed TLS by default. The use of SHA-1 for certificate signing constitutes a security risk. It is recommended to avoid dependencies on it, and consider stronger message digests instead.


### Log messages

The MQTT library disables all debug log messages by default. Do the following to enable log messages:

1. Add the `ENABLE_MQTT_LOGS` macro to the *DEFINES* in the code example's Makefile. The Makefile entry should look like as follows:
    ```
    DEFINES+=ENABLE_MQTT_LOGS
    ```

2. Call the `cy_log_init()` function provided by the *cy-log* module. cy-log is part of the *connectivity-utilities* library. See [connectivity-utilities library API documentation](https://infineon.github.io/connectivity-utilities/api_reference_manual/html/group__logging__utils.html) for cy-log details.


## Usage notes

- The `cy_mqtt_init()` and `cy_mqtt_deinit()` functions are not thread-safe.

- The application must allocate a network buffer; the same buffer must be passed while creating the MQTT object. The MQTT library uses this buffer for sending and receiving MQTT packets. The `CY_MQTT_MIN_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE` macro defined in *./include/cy_mqtt_api.h* specifies the minimum size of the network buffer required for the library to handle MQTT packets.

- The application must call `cy_mqtt_init()` before calling any other MQTT library function, and must not call other MQTT library functions after calling `cy_mqtt_deinit()`.

- An MQTT instance is created using `cy_mqtt_create`. The MQTT library allocates resources for each created instance; therefore, the application must delete the MQTT instance by calling `cy_mqtt_delete()` after executing the desired MQTT operations.

- After calling `cy_mqtt_delete`, all the resource associated with the MQTT handle are freed. Therefore, do not use the same MQTT handle after delete.

- If X509 certificate-based authentication is used, the password must be NULL in the MQTT connect request for the Azure MQTT broker.

- If SAS token-based authentication is used, values of RootCA, private key, and device certificate must be NULL in the MQTT connect request for the Azure MQTT broker.

- If SAS token-based authentication is used on a secured platform like CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W, you must set RootCA, device certificate, and key location as RAM to avoid reading them from a secured element during a TLS connection.

- The MQTT disconnection event notification is not sent to the application when disconnection is initiated from the application.

- When the application receives an MQTT disconnection event notification from library, then the application must call `cy_mqtt_disconnect()` to release the resource allocated during `cy_mqtt_connect()`. Below table summerizes the reasons for MQTT disconnection event from library.

   MQTT Event type | Reason | Description
   ----------------|--------|------------
   `CY_MQTT_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT` | `CY_MQTT_DISCONN_TYPE_NETWORK_DOWN` | When network is disconnected.
   `CY_MQTT_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT` | `CY_MQTT_DISCONN_TYPE_BROKER_DOWN` | When ping response is not received from broker for the ping request sent, <br>possibly broker is down.
   `CY_MQTT_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT` | `CY_MQTT_DISCONN_TYPE_BAD_RESPONSE` | When a bad response received form the MQTT broker. <br>Possibly received a MQTT packet with invalid packet type ID.
   `CY_MQTT_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT` | `CY_MQTT_DISCONN_TYPE_SND_RCV_FAIL` | When MQTT packet send/receive is failed due to high network latency and <br>smaller values set for `MQTT_RECV_POLLING_TIMEOUT_MS` and/or `MQTT_SEND_RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS` macros.
<br>


### Dependencies

For secured platforms such as CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W, the library depends on other libraries for PKCS-PSA support. Do the following to add dependent libraries:

1. If using .lib files, create a *.lib* file for freertos-pkcs11-psa as follows and add .lib file along with other dependent library .lib files:

    *freertos-pkcs11-psa.lib*: https://github.com/Linaro/freertos-pkcs11-psa/#80292d24f4978891b0fd35feeb5f1d6f6f0fff06

2. If using .mtb files, create a *.mtb file* for freertos-pkcs11-psa as follows and add .mtb file along with other dependent library *.mtb* files

   *freertos-pkcs11-psa.mtb*: https://github.com/Linaro/freertos-pkcs11-psa/#80292d24f4978891b0fd35feeb5f1d6f6f0fff06#$$ASSET_REPO$$/freertos-pkcs11-psa/master

3. Execute the `make getlibs` command.


### MQTT connection using provisioned certificates and keys

Do the following to establish a connection with the broker using credentials stored in the secured memory for secured platforms such as CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W:

1. Provision the kit with the device and RootCA certificates. See [Device provisioning steps](https://community.infineon.com/t5/Resource-Library/Provisioning-Guide-for-the-Cypress-CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W-Kit/ta-p/252469).

2. User can update device certificate and RootCA certificate by modifying respective the policy *.json* file with the device and RootCA certificate paths to be provisioned to the secured element as follows:

    ```
    "provisioning:"
    {
        "chain_of_trust": ["../certificates/device_cert.pem", "../certificates/rootCA.pem"]
    },
    ```

3. Add the `CY_TFM_PSA_SUPPORTED`, `TFM_MULTI_CORE_NS_OS`, and `CY_SECURE_SOCKETS_PKCS_SUPPORT` macros in the application Makefile. The Makefile entry should look like as follows:
    ```
    DEFINES+=CY_TFM_PSA_SUPPORTED TFM_MULTI_CORE_NS_OS CY_SECURE_SOCKETS_PKCS_SUPPORT
    ```
    **Note:** Do not pass any credentials/certificate from the application. While establishing the connection with the MQTT broker, certificates and keys stored in the secured memory are used.
